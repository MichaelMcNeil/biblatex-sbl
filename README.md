# biblatex-sbl â€” SBL style files for biblatex

This package provides biblatex support for citations in the format specified by the second edition of the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL) Handbook of Style.

All example notes and bibliography entries from the handbook are supported.

## Documentation

* `biblatex-sbl.pdf`: Style usage and documentation summary.
* `biblatex-sbl.bib`: Database entries for all example citations in the handbook.
* `biblatex-sbl-test.pdf`: Example usage for all example citations in the handbook.
* `biblatex-sbl-ibid.pdf`: Example usage of *ibidem* and *idem* settings.

## Manual Installation

* Copy `biblatex-sbl.def`, `sbl.cbx`, `sbl.bbx`, `sbl.dbx`, and `*.lbx` into `$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/biblatex-sbl/`
* Copy `*.pdf` into `$TEXMFHOME/doc/latex/biblatex-sbl/`
* Copy `biblatex-sbl.bib` into `$TEXMFHOME/bibtex/bib/biblatex-sbl/`

You can find `$TEXMFHOME` by running:

```        
kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME
```

## Requirements

The following packages are required:

* `biblatex` (version 3.1 or higher) with the `biber` backend
    - **Note:** `biber` 2.4 (which is used with `biblatex` 3.3) contains a bug which causes it to fail processing entries with both a `shorthand` and a `shortseries`.
* `xparse`
